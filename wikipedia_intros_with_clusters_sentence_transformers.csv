"Let's Turn Back the Years is a song written and originally recorded byHank WilliamsforMGM Records. By May 1952, Hank Williams was the biggest country music star in the world.  Despite his binge drinking and no shows, he appeared to be invincible on the country charts and had become the first country songwriter to make significant inroads into the pop charts.  Baby, We're Really in Love was in the charts for fifteen weeks starting in December 1951, and it was followed in March 1952 by Honky Tonk Blues, which peaked at #2 and stayed twelve weeks on the charts.  Honky Tonk Blues was followed in May by Half as Much, which peaked at #2 and stayed around for four months.  Cold, Cold Heart was still on the charts as 1952 dawned, and Hey Good Lookin' had yet to drop from heavy rotation.[3]However, Williams' personal life was heading in the other direction; much to his chagrin, he would be legally divorced from his wifeAudrey Williamson July 10, 1952.  Let's Turn Back the Years, which served as the B-side toCurley Williams' Half as Much, may have been his final plea to the love of his life to return to happier times.  The backing on the December 1951 session is believed to have beenDon Helms(steel guitar),Jerry Rivers(fiddle), possibly Sam Pruett (electric guitar), probablyJack Shook(acoustic guitar), andErnie Newtonor Howard Watts (bass).[4]Fred Roseproduced the session.",-1

"The2010World Lacrosse Championshipwas held between 15–24 July. This international men'sfield lacrossetournament organized by theFederation of International Lacrossetook place inManchester, United Kingdom. This was the third time that the tournament was played in Greater Manchester, after the1978and1994championships. TheUnited Statescaptured their ninth gold medal, defeatingCanada12–10 in the championship game.[1]Paul Rabilof Team USA was named tournament MVP.[2]Australia earned its fourth-straight bronze medal by defeating Japan 16 –9. A record 29 nations competed at the event, eight more than the2006 WLCinLondon, Ontario. The 101 games were held at the Armitage Centre,Manchester University's sports grounds.[3][4] For the first time, a FIL World Lacrosse Festival ran alongside the world championships from 17 to 22 July. 48 teams from around the world competed in 8 divisions from U16 to Grand Masters.[5] TheIroquois Nationals' participation in the championships was prevented in a dispute over their passports.[6]The team sought to travel onHaudenosaunee passports, but the United Kingdom government would not allow it because of increased passport security requirements.[7]TheUnited States Department of Stateinitially also refused to allow the passports, but later granted the team a one-time waiver to travel to the tournament. However, the U.K. would not issue the team visas.[8] Initially, the Iroquois were hoping to be able to travel, and agreed to forfeit their first game against England. Because it was the opening game of the tournament, organizers arranged for the host team to play Germany in an exhibition match instead.[9]However, just before game time, the FIL decided to move Germany to the Blue Division and the Iroquois to the Plum Division, making the England-Germany match an official one.[10]The Iroquois team did not officially withdraw from the tournament, and would have been allowed to play its remaining games should it have resolved its passport difficulties in time.[11]On 18 July, the FIL announced that the competition schedule had progressed too far to allow Iroquois to compete in the tournament.[12]Each of the other three Plum Division teams were given 1–0 forfeit victories over the Iroquois team. For pool play, nations were separated into seven divisions according to strength, the top six teams were placed in the Blue Division, and the other teams were put in six divisions of four. Each of the thirty nations were eligible to win the championship. Each division played round-robin games for ranking to determine which tournament brackets they would be placed in. The Blue Division originally consisted of the top six teams from the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship, but Germany was moved up to replace the missing Iroquois team. The first and second place teams from the Blue Division advanced to the tournament semifinals. The third and fourth place teams advanced to the quarterfinals. The fifth and sixth place teams were placed into the 5th through 8th place classification bracket. Canada's 10–9 win over the United States marked the first time that the American team lost a preliminary round game in any world championship, and only its third loss overall.[13]Both teams ended up advancing to the semifinals. Japan, Australia, and England all finished 2–3 in the Blue Division and 1–1 in head-to-head matches against each other. All three games between the teams were close, with two going into overtime. Japan and Australia advanced to the quarterfinals based on goal differential in those matches.",-1

"TheHabeas Corpus Act of 1867(sess. ii, chap. 28, 14Stat.385) is anact of Congressthat significantly expanded thejurisdictionoffederal courtsto issue writs ofhabeas corpus.[1]Passed February 5, 1867, the Act amended theJudiciary Act of 1789to grant the courts the power to issue writs of habeas corpus in all cases where any person may be restrained of their liberty in violation of the constitution, or any treaty or law of the United States.[2]Prior to the Act's passage, prisoners in the custody of one of the states who wished to challenge the legality of their detention could petition for a writ of habeas corpus only in state courts; the federal court system was barred from issuing writs of habeas corpus in their cases.[1][3]The Act also permitted the court to go beyond the return and question the truth of the jailer's stated justification for detaining the petitioning prisoner, whereas prior to the Act courts were technically bound to accept the jailer's word that the prisoner was actually being held for the reason stated.[4]The Act largely restored habeas corpus following its1863 suspension by Congress, ensuring that anyone arrested after its passage could challenge their detention in the federal courts, but denied habeas relief to anyone who was already in military custody for any military offense or for having aided the Confederacy.[2] Another feature of the 1867 Act is that it extended the reach of habeas to include interpersonal detention as well as official detainment: Although some states already had statutes applying habeas to interpersonal as well as official confinement, such as in the case of Missouri'sfreedom suitprovision,[5]this federal expansion of habeas allowed petitioners in states that had not already done so to use habeas to challenge confinement contrary to the constitution, particularly in the case of coercive labor contracts that closely resembled enslavement. When the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 is spoken of, it is usually this act that is meant.[1][4]Another act dealing with habeas corpus was passed the same day and appears on the same page of theUnited States Statutes at Large, being the twenty-seventh rather than the twenty-eighth chapter. It amended theHabeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863, which permitted (among other things) government officials charged with abusing their powers under the suspension of habeas corpus to have their cases heard at the federal rather than state level.[6]The 1867 Act ensured that the federal courts could effectively hear the cases transferred to them by issuing a writ forhabeas corpus cum causa.[7] The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867: The Supreme Court as Legal Historian, Mayers L., 33 U.Chi.L.Rev. 31 (1965).",-1

In 1763, theBritish Crown declaredthat only it could acquire land from First Nations through treaties.[1]Historically, only two treaties were signed with the First Nations of British Columbia. The first of these was theDouglas Treaties, negotiated bySir James Douglaswith the native people of southernVancouver Islandfrom 1850 to 1854.[2]The second treaty,Treaty 8, signed in 1899, was part of theNumbered Treatiesthat were signed with First Nations across the Prairie regions.[3]British Columbian Treaty 8 signatories are located in thePeace River Countryor the far north-east of BC.  For over nine decades no more treaties were signed with First Nations of BC; many Native people wished to negotiate treaties, but successive BC provincial governments refused until the 1990s.[4][5]A major development was the 1997 decision of theSupreme Court of Canadain theDelgamuukw v. British Columbiacase that Aboriginal title still exists in British Columbia and that when dealing withCrown land, the government must consult with and may have to compensate First Nations whose rights are affected.[6]",-1

"Berkeley Addison(bapt. 4 June 1815 – 13 January 1882) was a British Anglican clergyman, the first vicar ofJesmond,Newcastle upon Tynefrom 1861 to 1882, following the erection ofJesmond Parish Church. Berkeley Addison was the second son of the Rev. Joseph Addison, ofShifnal, Shropshire, and was educated atPeterhouse, Cambridge, where he was classical prizeman in 1836, and graduatedB.A.in 1839.[1] Ordained deacon in 1839, and priest in 1840, he held brief curacies atBrightonandKensington, and in 1843 settled inEdinburghas curate underDean Ramsaywhere he remained for twelve years.[1]According to the 1851 census, he was married to Eliza, had three daughters and three sons, and maintained a groom and six female domestic servants.[2]In 1855 he was appointed rector ofCollyhurst, near Manchester.[1] Jesmond Parish Church was erected as a protest against the election ofClement Moody, vicar of Newcastle, as master of the Mary Magdalene Hospital and chaplain to theChurch of St Thomas the Martyrin Newcastle in 1856. The basis of the new church's foundation was the wish of its congregation to be served by anEvangelicalminister. Against that brief, Adamson was selected and brought to Newcastle at the close of 1860, prior to the concecration of the new building in 1861.[1] Richard Welforddescribes Adamson as an eloquent preacher, a fluent platform speaker, and a liberal-minded man, who soon became popular in Newcastle. When the School Board was formed in the town, he was put forward as one of the Church candidates, and, of the fifteen representatives elected, was returned tenth on the poll. His fellow-members elected him to be the first vice-chairman of the Board, from which position he succeeded to the chairmanship, a post which he occupied until his retirement in 1877.[1] From 1874 to 1880 he was proctor for theArchdeaconry of Northumberland, and in the meantime was presented with an honorary canonry of Durham.[1] The congregation at Jesmond celebrated the twentieth anniversary of his ministry by presenting him with a purse of gold containing £320, and an address, in which his faithful services were recognised, and a hope was expressed that he might be long spared to uphold and expound those great principles of the Reformation which Jesmond Church was founded to perpetuate.[1] Canon Addison was not a voluminous writer, but he had a ready pen, and frequently used it. He was the author of two volumes,The Ark of IsraelandThe Rod of Moses. He also published various pamphlets against theOxford Movement, and a series of addresses entitledManchester Lectures.[1] Addison died on 13 January 1882, at Jesmond Vicarage, Newcastle, in his 67th year.[1]",-1

"Final Distance is a song by Japanese recording artistHikaru Utadafor her third studio albumDeep River(2002). Written by Utada herself, the song was produced and composed by long-time collaborators Akira Miyake, Utada's fatherTeruzane Utadaand herself. Final Distance was originally recorded as Distance which was taken from thealbum with the same name, despite not being a single. The song was re-recorded, re-arranged, and dedicated to Rena Yamashita, a six-year-old victim of theIkeda school massacrewho had written an essay about being inspired by Utada. Utada had stated that the meaning of the word final for the song Final Distance is most important rather than last. Musically, Final Distance incorporates more instrumentation than the previous version, includingviolins, an acoustic piano and synthesizers. The song strips the originalpop musicfrom Distance and is apop balladsong. Despite being written in 2000 from the original version, Utada reflected on the emotions of sorrow, pain, anger and celebration of life while recording the single version. Final Distance received positive reception from most music critics, who praised the re-arrangement and favored this version, although some critics felt the song was inferior to her past ballad tracks. Critics have cited the track as one of Utada's career highlights. Commercially, Final Distance stalled at number two on theOricon Singles Chart, making it her first single in two years to have missed the top spot. The song also resulted in being her lowest selling physical singles at the time but was surpassed by her 2004 single Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro.

"TheBürgi–Dunitz angle(BD angle) is one of two angles that fully define the geometry of attack (approach via collision) of anucleophileon atrigonalunsaturatedcenter in amolecule, originally thecarbonylcenter in anorganicketone, but now extending toaldehyde,ester, andamidecarbonyls, and toalkenes(olefins) as well.[1][2][3]The angle was named after crystallographersHans-Beat BürgiandJack D. Dunitz, its first senior investigators. Practically speaking, the Bürgi–Dunitz and Flippin–Lodge angles were central to the development of understanding ofchiral chemical synthesis, and specifically of the phenomenon ofasymmetric inductionduring nucleophilic attack at hindered carbonyl centers (see theCram–Felkin–Anhand Nguyen[clarification needed]models).[4][5] Additionally, the stereoelectronic principles that underlie nucleophiles adopting a proscribed range of Bürgi–Dunitz angles may contribute to the conformational stability of proteins[6][7]and are invoked to explain the stability of particular conformations of molecules in one hypothesis of achemical origin of life.[8]",-1

"Scouting America, formerly the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of the largest privateyouth organizationsin the United States, has policies which prohibit those who are not willing to subscribe to the Scouting America's Declaration of Religious Principle, which has been interpreted by some as banningatheists,[1]and, until January 2014, prohibited all known or avowedhomosexuals, from membership in its Scouting program.[2]The ban on adults who are open or avowed homosexuals[3]from leadership positions was lifted in July 2015.[4] The BSA had contended that its policies were essential in its mission to instill in young people thevaluesof theScout Promise, or Oath, andScout Law.[1][5]The organization's legal right to have these policies was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. InBoy Scouts of America v. Dale(2000), theSupreme Court of the United Statesaffirmed that as a private organization, the BSA can set its own membership standards. The BSA's policies have been legally challenged but have not been found to constitute discrimination because as a private organization in the United States, the BSA has the right tofreedom of association,[6]as determined in the court case.[7]In recent years, the policy disputes have led to litigation over the terms under which the BSA can access governmental resources, including public lands. These policies have led to various disputes and controversies. On May 23, 2013, the BSA's National Council approved a resolution to remove the restriction denying membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation alone effective January 1, 2014. BSA removed a similar restriction for adult leaders on July 27, 2015.[8] According to its mission statement, the Boy Scouts of America seeks to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.[5]All members are required, as a condition of membership, to promise to uphold and obey both of these pledges. The texts of the BSA'sScout OathandScout Lawfor Boy Scouting have remained unchanged since they were approved in 1911,[7]and every member agrees to follow them on his or her application form. In reciting the Scout Oath, Scouts promise to do their duty to God and to be morally straight; the Scout Law holds that a Scout is clean andreverent. As early as 1978, the Boy Scouts of America circulated a memorandum among national executive staff stating that it was not appropriate for homosexuals to hold leadership positions in BSA (this has since changed).[9]Similarly, since at least 1985, the BSA has interpreted the Scout Oath and Law as requiring belief in a God or higher power.[10]In both instances, the organization asserted it was enforcing long-held policies which had never been published or publicly challenged.[9][11]Currently, the organization's membership policy states, It is the philosophy of Scouting to welcome all eligible youth, regardless of race, ethnic background, gender or orientation, who are willing to accept Scouting’s values and meet any other requirements of membership. Prejudice, intolerance and unlawful discrimination are unacceptable within the ranks of the Boy Scouts of America.[12] The Boy Scouts of America makes a division between its Scouting programs and theLearning for Lifeprogram. The traditional Scouting programs areCub Scouting,Boy Scouting, andVenturing.Exploringis the worksite-based program of Learning for Life. The positions on religious or spiritual belief within Scouting programs do not apply to leadership positions and membership in the Learning for Life programs.[13][14]",-1

"Wax emulsions are stablemixturesof one or morewaxesinwater. Waxes and water are normallyimmisciblebut can be brought together stably by the use ofsurfactantsand a clever preparation process. Strictly speaking a wax emulsion should be called a wax dispersion since the wax is solid at room temperature. However, because the preparation takes place above the melting point of the wax, the actual process is called emulsification, hence the name wax emulsion. In praxis, wax dispersion is used for solvent based systems. A wide range of emulsions based on different waxes and blends thereof are available, depending on the final application. Waxes that are found in wax emulsions can be of natural or synthetic origin. Common non-fossil natural waxes are carnaubawax, beeswax, candelilla wax or ricebran wax. Paraffin, microcrystalline and montanwax are the most used fossil natural waxes that are found in emulsions. Synthetic waxes that are used include (oxidised) LDPE and HDPE,maleic anhydridegraftedpolypropyleneand Fischer-Tropsch waxes. A range of different emulsifiers or surfactants are used to emulsify waxes. These can be anionic, cationic or non-ionic in nature. The most common however are fatty alcohol ethoxylates as non-ionic surfactants due to their superb stability against hard water, pH-shock and electrolytes. Some applications demand different emulsifier systems for example anionic surfactants for better hydrophobicity or cationic surfactants for better adhesion to certain materials like textile fibers. Wax emulsions are widely used in a variety of technical applications like printing inks & lacquers, leather and textiles, paper, wood, metal, polishes, glass fiber sizing, glass bottle protection among other things. The most important properties that can be improved by the addition of wax emulsions are matting & gloss, hydrophobicity, soft touch, abrasion & rub resistance, scratch resistance, release, corrosion protection and anti-blocking.[1] Emulsions based on natural waxes are used for coating fruits and candies and crop protection. Synthetic wax based emulsions are often used in food packaging. Wax emulsions based on beeswax, carnauba wax and paraffin wax are used in creams and ointments. The emergence of soybean waxes with varying properties and melt points has led to the use of vegetable wax emulsions in applications such as paper coatings, paint and ink additives, and even wet sizing for pulp and paper applications. These wax emulsions can be formulated to deliver some of the same properties that petroleum-based wax emulsions deliver, but offer advantages of being a green product and offer more consistent availability.[2]",-1

"Niccolò Giani(20 June 1909 – 14 March 1941) was anItalianFascistphilosopher and journalist who was the founder ofFascist mysticism. After attending the Dante Alighieri High School inTriestehe moved toMilan, where in 1928 he enrolled in theFaculty of Law, graduating in 1931. While at theUniversity of Milanhe also joined theFascist University Groups(GUF). On 4 April 1930 Giani announced the imminent founding of theSchool of Fascist Mysticism, which he opened in Milan a few weeks later along withArnaldo Mussolini. In 1931 Giani became director of the school, a post he left at the end of the following year due to internal conflicts with the political secretary of the GUF as well as the failure to move the school to the old headquarters ofIl Popolo d'Italia, known as Il covo (The Lair), one of the most important settings of the fascist imaginary, as he complained in a letter to Mussolini.[1][2] Giani then continued to collaborate with various newspapers, such asIl Popolo d'ItaliaandGerarchia. According to his thought, Fascism had to return to its origins, that is to therevolutionary movement of 1919, ideally linked to the experience of the firstsquadristiand theArditiof theGreat War; a more radicalrevolutioncombined with the recovery of a morefundamentalisttradition. More than the political statements of the Sansepolcro manifesto, however, Giani exalted the struggle of young people against thebourgeoisiein the early postwar period; Fascist mysticism considered itself the representative of this youthful world inspired by the love of country, a guard of the permanent revolution in contrast with the opportunists and careerists. He identified four main mystics in the contemporary era, destined to bring benefits at first but then to fail:liberalism,democracy,socialismandcommunism. According to him, Liberalism, democracy, socialism and communism are the four mystics currently dominating in modern society. The balance - we have already seen - is negative for all. Liberalism leads to anarchy, democracy to political and social instability, socialism to civil struggle, communism to primitive life. These four mystics are therefore anti-historical. Faced with them, the only mysticism capable of overcoming these crises was the fascist one, whose knowledge and dissemination among the masses was the task of the intellectual elites.[3][4][5][6] In 1934, his essay Outlines on the Social Order of the State resulted in him obtaining the post of free lecturer inlabor lawandsocial securityand then the chair of History and Doctrine of Fascism at theUniversity of Pavia; in 1935, however, after having married Maria Rosa Sampietro, he volunteered for theSecond Italo-Ethiopian Warby enlisting with the rank ofcapomanipolo(lieutenant) of theVoluntary Militia for National Securityin the 128th Blackshirt Battalion Vercelli. After returning from Ethiopia, in late 1936 Giani returned to the position of director of the School of Fascist Mysticism, resuming the publication of the Notebooks of the school of Fascist mysticism, dealing with various issues; in 1937 he founded a monthly magazine,Dottrina fascista(Fascist Doctrine), which became the official magazine of the School of Fascist Mysticism, in which in 1939 he published the Decalogue of the new Italian, taken from the writings and speeches of Arnaldo Mussolini.[7][8][9][10] He also devoted himself to journalism, becoming director of the newspaperCronaca prealpinainVareseand collaborating with various newspapers, includingTempo di Mussolini. In 1938 he was among the signatories of theManifesto of Race, supporting the proclamation of theItalian Racial Laws, and in 1939 he took part in theanti-Jewishcampaign from the pages ofCronaca prealpina, based on his own convictions of spiritualracism, complementary to the Nazi biological racism; in 1939 he published the article Why we are anti-Semites.[11][12][13][14] In 1939, after long pressuring by Giani, the official seat of the School of Fascist Mysticism moved to Il Covo, with a ceremony presided over by the secretary of the PNFAchille Starace. Over the years the Covo had been transformed into a permanentmuseumof the Fascist Revolution, and starting from 15 November 1939 the entire building had been proclaimed a national monument complete with an honor guard made of squadrists and war veterans. Between 19 and 20 February 1940, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the school's foundation, Giani organized the National Convention of Fascist Mystic in Milan, which in his intentions should have been the first of a series, but none followed due to Italy’s entry intoWorld War II.[15] Like most of the mystics, Giani again enlisted as a volunteer, this time in the11th Alpini Regiment; he saw the war as the harbinger of a revolution that would lead to a new era. In June 1940 he took part in thebattle of the Western AlpsagainstFrance, being awarded aSilver Medal of Military Valorfor an action carried out on June 24, 1940. After theArmistice of Villa IncisaGiani returned to civilian life, but in the meantime thewar in North Africa had begun; he repeatedly requested to be sent to the new front as a volunteer, but without success. Finally, on 9 November 1940 he was able to leave forNorth Africaaswar correspondentofIl Popolo d'Italia,Cronaca PrealpinaandL'Illustrazione Italiana, attached to the units of theRegia Aeronautica. In addition to his activity as a journalist, he also participated in flight missions, obtaining aBronze Medal of Military Valor. On 28 December 1940 he was recalled to Italy where he resumed the leadership ofCronaca prealpinain Varese.[16][17] In February 1941 he again volunteered for theGreco-Italian War, once again assigned to the 11th Alpini Regiment. On 14 March 1941 he volunteered to lead an attack aimed at capturing the northern tip of Mali i Shëndëllisë, a mountain inAlbaniaheld by the Greeks; his squad succeeded in capturing the Greek outpost, but was then driven back by a Greek counterattack, in which Giani was killed inhand-to-hand combat. He was posthumously awarded theGold Medal of Military Valor.[18][19]",-1

"White-eyeis white soil with lime nodules, which is non-stratified, geologically recent deposits of silty or loamy material, deposited by the wind and cemented together with calcium carbonate[1]concretions. White soil deposits with lime nodules are found in theilluvialhorizons of soils that formed onloessand loess-like loams. In the soil profile, the nodules stand out as bright spots with a clear and rounded shape. The size of spots is 1–2 cm in diameter, which is comparable to the size of an eye, and, more specifically, to that of the species of birds known asWhite-eye. Thus, the name White-eye for loess with lime nodules may have been derived from their comparison to these birds. Unlike other forms of carbonate nodules, which are often found in more solid rock, loess deposits with lime nodules are soft and crumbly,[2]or loose.

"The Kingdom of the Cults, first published in 1965, is a  reference book of theChristian countercult movementin theUnited States, written byBaptistminister and  counter-cultistWalter Ralston Martin.[1]As of 2019, the book is in its sixth updated edition (hardbackISBN9780764232657). Martin examines a large number ofnew religious movements; included are major groups such asChristian Science,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Jehovah's Witnesses,Armstrongism,Theosophy, theBaháʼí Faith,Unitarian Universalism, andScientology, as well as  minor groups such asSwedenborgianismandRosicrucianism, plus variousNew Ageand groups based onEastern religions. The beliefs of other world religions such asIslamandBuddhismare also discussed. Martin covers each group's history and teachings, contrasting them with those of mainstream Protestant Christianity.[1][2]In an appendix titled The Puzzle of Seventh-day Adventism, Martin partially rehabilitated the reputation of theSeventh-day Adventist Churchin the midst of the ongoingEvangelical-Adventist controversy. In contrast with some standard secular definitions of the word,[3]Martin narrowly defines acultin theological terms as a group of people gathered about a specific person—or person's misinterpretation of the Bible, while admitting that in spite of distorting Scripture such groups' beliefs may contain considerable truths that have biblical support but have become de-emphasized by mainstream Christianity, such asdivine healingandprophecy.[1] By 1989,The Kingdom of the Cultshad sold over 500,000 copies and was one of the ten best-selling American spiritual books. The book has been described as being regarded byevangelicalsas the authoritative reference work on major cult systems for nearly 40 years.[4]However, it has been criticized by members of some of the groups it discusses, particularlyMormons, who object that their faith should be labeled a cult.[4][5][6] There have been several editions over the years with some changes. In the 1985 edition theNation of Islamwas not mentioned, and in the 2003 edition it was put back in a chapter onIslamitself.[7]After Martin's death, a revised and expanded edition was issued that listedRavi K.

"Gervase Paganellinherited the feudal barony of Dudley (which includedDudley Castle) around the year 1150. However, after rebelling against King Henry II, his castle was demolished. Gervase founded theCluniacPriory of St JamesinDudleyand probably founded theChurch of St Thomasin Dudley. He died in 1194. The first of the family of Paganell to hold Dudley Castle and the barony of Dudley was Fulke Paganell around the year 1100. Dudley Castle was originally a wooden Norman castle, built byAnsculf de Picquigny, a follower of William the Conqueror.[1]At the time of theDomesday surveyin 1086, the castle was in the possession of his sonWilliam fitz Ansculftogether with manors in theHome countiesand the English Midlands, which were rewards for services to the Conqueror. Dudley Castle was thecaputof the feudal barony. The Paganell family had origins in Normandy, where Fulke's father William was Lord of Moutiers Hubert.[2]It is not clear how Fulke came into possession of the barony of Dudley. One suggestion is that he married Beatrice ferch William, a daughter of William FitzAnsculf,[1]but it cannot be ruled out that he may have benefited from the previous owner being dispossessed after a failed rebellion.[3]The family name is still attached to one of their former Buckinghamshire possessions,Newport Pagnell. Dudley Castle was converted to a stone fortification by Fulke or his son and heir Ralph.[3]In the struggle for power betweenKing StephenandMatilda, a period of history known asThe Anarchy, Ralph took the side of Matilda, which led to the castle being besieged by Stephen in 1138.[4]Since the castle survived the siege, it is assumed that it had been rebuilt in stone by that time. Ralph was made Governor of the Castle of Nottingham in 1140.[5]Ralph's successor to the barony was his son, Gervase. Although the exact date of Gervase becoming Lord of Dudley is not known, he had inherited by 1150.[3]By 1154, he had married, his wife being the recently widowed Countess Isabel.[3]She had been previously married toSimon de Senlisand was the daughter ofRobert, Earl of Leicester.[6] In 1166, he was assessed as holding 55 and two-thirdsknight's fees.[1]Gervase was involved ina failed rebellionagainst King Henry II in 1173–4 that led to an order that the castle be demolished. He was later restored to the king's favour after making him a payment of a fine of 500marks.[7]It is not clear how much of the original stone castle was demolished, but it is usually assumed that the site remained an unfortified manor house until the second half of the 13th century.[8] Gervase founded aCluniac priory in Dudleydedicated to St James,[9][10]fulfilling a wish of his father, Ralph.[11]It is also thought that he founded the Church of St Thomas in Dudley.[12]The church was originally dedicated toThomas Becket, who was killed in 1170 and canonized in 1173. Gervase attended the coronation ofKing Richard Iin 1189.[6] When he died in 1194, his heir was his sister Hawise, who had married John de Somery.

Taoist on the Moon Mountain), was an expert of irrigation works, artist, and a government official of theYuan dynasty.[1]He was born in Qinglong Town, Songjiang (松江青龙镇 – present dayQingpu District, Shanghai).[1] Ren drew some outstanding paintings of horses, people, flowers and birds. His style is similar to the artists of theTang dynasty(608–907) and he is considered a direct successor toLi Gonglin(1049–1106) of theNorthern Song dynasty. His paintings of horses are comparable to those byZhao Mengfu.[2] Despite his position under alien Mongol emperors, Ren did not shy from producing works with a political subtext. His inscription onFat and Lean Horsesexplains that the fat horse represents the self-satisfied, wealthy official and the lean one the humble, poor, self-deprecating official.[3] Ren's hydrological works include dredging the area in what is now Beijing to improve the water supply and leading a team to build embankments after the Yellow River burst its banks.[1]",-1

"William Storm Halstead(1903 inMount Kisco, NY– September 1987 inLos Angeles, CA) was an American inventor who held more than 80 patents involving radio and television development. As a student atHaverford CollegeHalstead was instrumental in creating the Haverford College Radio Club, and building and launching its AM radio station WABQ in 1923. It was only the second radio station in Pennsylvania, and was described at the time as having “one of the most unusual forms of aerials ever used by a radio broadcasting station.” (See The New York Times reference and original article from December 14, 1934, below.) See alsoList of Haverford College people. In 1950, he pioneered stereophonic broadcasting. The process he developed allowed a station to use a sideband of its frequency to broadcast subsidiary programming. This process was calledmultiplexing, and once fully instituted removed the need for two stations, and thus two receivers at the listener's end in order to achieve a stereophonic effect. Japan credits Halstead with helping them to developNippon Television. He was so honored by Japan that a memorial service for him was held by the Japanese delegation to the UN at theChurch Center for the United Nationsin New York City in 1987. He also planned television systems in India, Jordan and Uganda. In addition he was instrumental in the beginnings ofRadio y Televisión Martíwhich was developed during the Reagan administration and went on-air in 1983. Its mission was to fight communism in Cuba and it was based on theRadio Free Europe/Radio Libertymodel. Two more forerunners among his inventions were a portable shortwave radio system for forest rangers and a cable system that allowed motorists at Los Angeles International Airport to get traffic and flight information on their car radios. In the 1950s, his wife Leslie Munro Halstead, became the first woman to hold the title of Vice President of a national advertising agency when she took over a role at Kenyon & Eckhart. In 1985, through mergers, it became Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt. In the 1990s, the firm shortened its name to Bozell Worldwide. William and Leslie Halstead had two children.

"AnEAN-8is an EAN/UPC symbologybarcodeand is derived from the longerInternational Article Number(EAN-13) code.[1]It was introduced for use on small packages where an EAN-13 barcode would be too large; for example oncigarettes,pencils, andchewing gumpackets. It is encoded identically to the 12 digits of theUPC-Abarcode, except that it has 4 (rather than 6) digits in each of the left and right halves.[citation needed] EAN-8 barcodes may be used to encodeGTIN-8(8-digit Global Trade Identification Numbers) which are product identifiers from theGS1 System. A GTIN-8 begins with a 2- or 3-digit GS1 prefix (which is assigned to each national GS1 authority) followed by a 5- or 4-digit item reference element depending on the length of the GS1 prefix), and a checksum digit. EAN-8 codes are common throughout the world, and companies may also use them to encode RCN-8 (8-digit Restricted Circulation Numbers), and use them to identify own-brand products sold only in their stores. RCN-8 are a subset of GTIN-8 which begin with a first digit of 0 or 2.[2]",-1

"TheLinnaean Society of New England(1814–1822) was established inBoston,Massachusetts, to promotenatural history. The society organized a natural history museum and also arranged lectures and excursions for its members. In 1817 it became involved in theGloucester sea serpentdebate. Although the society itself did not last, its initial energy and rapid accomplishments helped shape the growing field of natural history in the early years of the United States. The society began December 8, 1814, at the room of Dr.Jacob Bigelow. Founders included Bigelow; Walter Channing; Ezekiel D. Cushing;James Freeman Dana; George Hayward; LaFayette Perkins; Octavius Pickering; William Smith Shaw; Nathaniel Tucker; John Ware; andJohn White Webster.[1]John Davisserved as president. Meetings were held weekly, on Saturday evenings. The members were divided into 6 classes: viz., for minerals; for plants and vegetables; for quadrupeds and birds; for fishes, reptiles, and serpents; for insects; and for vermes, corals, madrepores, &c.[2]Initially, the society had a room in Joy's Buildings in Boston; they soon moved toBoylston Market. In January 1815, the society agreed to call itself the Linnaean Society of New England (instead of its previous name, New-England Society for the Promotion of Natural History.) It officially incorporated, in June 1820. Affiliates of the society included: Thomas G. Chase;[3]Parker Cleaveland;[4]Samuel Luther Dana;Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn;[5]Oliver Fiske;[6]Francis Calley Gray;[3]Samuel Latham Mitchill;[7]Nathan Read; and William J. Walker.[1] In addition to meetings, the society organized relevant excursions. In the summer of 1816, members travelled to the mountains in New Hampshire and Vermont. They ascertained the height of theMonadnockto be 3,450 feet; its summit composed of micaceousschistus. TheAscutney3,106 feet, its summit of granite. TheWhite Mountains6,230 feet, the summit ofgneiss, the sides micaceous schistus. The limit of forest trees at the height of 4,423 feet. These heights were ascertained by barometrical observations. They found few interesting minerals, but discovered 3 or 4 new species of plants.[8] Shortly after the formation of the society, it shared with the public its plans to create a museum of natural history. The society, unwilling to raise expectations which might not be realized, or to announce objects beyond their power to effect, have chosen for the present to confine their views principally to the collection of a regular and systematick Museum of Natural History, in which Animals, Plants, and Minerals shall be kept in a good state of preservation, designated by their scientific and ordinary names, and arranged according to their classes and natural affinities. It is hoped that a collection thus formed, will be useful to students, and may hereafter be instrumental in throwing some light on the natural history of this country.[9] The collection of the museum grew by donations from members and supporters. It was hoped that travellers abroad would bring back specimens. Society members particularly request masters of vessels and other gentlemen bound on sea voyages, to preserve for them such curiosities as may fall in their way.[9]In addition, the new society wrote to their contacts abroad. Society members have ... opened a considerable correspondence with a view to obtaining foreign specimens. The chief objects which they are desirous to possess are minerals, plants, and fresh seeds of rare species, quadrupeds, birds in pairs with their nests and eggs, fishes, serpents, insects, shells, coral, &c.[9] It also was hoped that locals at home would contribute birds, fish, &c. the common, and especially the rare, which are now and then brought to a town for sale. Many valuable articles have already been obtained in this manner, and by offering a trifling pecuniary inducement, individuals might be enabled to procure others which are not used for food, but which are very interesting to the naturalist.[10]Indeed, persons residing in the interiour of the country will confer an obligation on the society, by sending any ... objects which may appear to them curious or unusual. ... Printed directions for preserving birds, fishes, quadrupeds, plants, &c. may be received, gratis, at theBoston Atheneum, Tremont-street.[11] A newspaper notice of July 1820 advised the public that donations of natural history specimens could be dropped off at a drug store on Central Street. The friends of this institution are informed that its members will receive and preserve specimens in the various departments of history, and for the convenience of those who have specimens to present, Mr. Thomas G. Chase, druggist, no.7, Central-street, has obligingly offered to receive them at his store. A note left with him, stating where specimens intended for the museum are deposited, will be duly attended to.[10] Among the donations, the first one specified was a likeness of Mr. Roscoe, presented by Mr.Francis Boott. Commodore Stewart, of the frigateConstitutionpresented 2 living tigers. These tigers were somehow lost. ... A living bear fromCommodore Chauncey; Chinese insects from B.P. Tilden; corals from Dr. Swift; minerals from Vesuvius; birds from France; birds from Africa; a series of English game-birds; a caribou; and, above all ... 'the most interesting and valuable specimen the country affords; namely, a large species of deer, commonly called the elk.'[2] The museum itself, located inBoylston Hall, was open to the public: strangers and others can have free access on application to any member or officer of the society.[3]According to a contemporary description: In 1817 the society investigated reports of sightings of anextraordinary sea serpentnorth of Boston, aroundGloucesterandCape Ann, Massachusetts. Members of the society circulated systematic questionnaires, and wrote up a scientifically-informed report, published the same year. The report included information onErik Pontoppidan's Norway sea snake, and on a smaller Cape Ann sea animal actually examined, a remarkable serpent, supposed to be the progeny of the great serpent.[13]To accommodate its findings the society established a new genus: Scoliophis Atlanticus. The smaller specimen was exhibited publicly. At the time, controversy raged over the society's report. For example: With respect to the little animal which was exhibited by Capt. Beach, and on which a committee of the Boston Linnaean Society established a new genus, under the imposing title of Scoliophis, concluding it to be the young of the sea-serpent, I understand that a celebrated French naturalist, now in Philadelphia, has ascertained that it is a common land snake of the U. States, of a harmless species, and that the undulations of the spine were merely the effect of disease. The editor of the Philadelphia newspaper that had printed this item also published his own remarks: the evidence of the existence of the Sea-Monster is conclusive and irresistable.[14][15]Eventually, experts concluded that the Linnaean Society's findings were incorrect. What had been thought to be a new species was in fact a black snake –Coluber constrictor.[16] The society faded out due to members' other priorities. In 1822 they agreed to suspend the meetings, give up the rooms, and place the collection, or such part of it as can be preserved, in some place where it may occasion no further expense to the Society. ... The perishable specimens, such as stuffed skins and specimens in alcohol, were given toMr. Greenwood, the proprietor of theNew-England Museum.[17]The remainder of the collection was offered to the Boston Athenaeum, which declined; and then to Harvard College, which accepted the offer and its terms. However, it soon became clear that Harvard would not fulfill the terms of the agreement. In 1830 the former society's specimens were reclaimed (--a few empty glazed cases, or containing dilapidated monkeys and birds--) and given to the newly formedBoston Society of Natural History.[2]",-1

The manufacturing processes of mostcheesesin Mexico are still rustic and traditional, similar to the manufacturing process that was used upon its invention. Due to the traditional means of production of dairy products in Mexico some dairy products have a conflicting shelf-life which leads to earlier expiration.

"Cue reactivityis a type of learned response which is observed in individuals with anaddictionand involves significantphysiologicalandpsychologicalreactions to presentations of drug-relatedstimuli(i.e.,drug cues).[1][2]The central tenet of cue reactivity is that cues previously predicting receipt of drug reward under certain conditions can evoke stimulus associated responses such as urges to use drugs.[3]In other words, learned cues can signaldrug reward, in that cues previously associated with drug use can elicit cue-reactivity such as arousal, anticipation, and changes in behavioral motivation.[4][3]Responses to a drug cue can bephysiological(e.g., sweating, salivation, brain activity),behavioral(e.g., drug seeking), or symbolic expressive (e.g., craving).[3]The clinical utility of cue reactivity is based on the conceptualization that drug cues elicit craving which is a critical factor in the maintenance and relapse to drug use.[5][6]Additionally, cue reactivity allows for the development of testable hypotheses grounded in established theories of human behavior.[4]Therefore, researchers have leveraged the cue reactivity paradigm to studyaddiction, antecedents of relapse, andcraving, translate pre-clinical findings to clinical samples, and contribute to the development of new treatment methods.[4]Testing cue reactivity in human samples involves exposing individuals with a substance use disorder to drug-related cues (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol,drug paraphernalia) and drug neutral cues (e.g., pencils, glasses of water), and then measuring their reactions by assessing changes in self-reported drug craving and physiological responses (e.g., blood pressure, salivation, brain activity).[4][7]",-1

"Thelaw of the caseis alegalterm of artthat is applicable mainly incommon law, or Anglo-American, jurisdictions that recognize the related doctrine ofstare decisis.The phrase refers to instances where rulings made by a trial court and not challenged on appeal become the law of the case.[1]Unless the trial court's rulings were clearly in error or there has been an important change in circumstances, the court's prior rulings must stand.[2]Usually the situation occurs when either a case is on appeal for the second time—e.g.if the reviewing court remanded the matter to the trial court and the party appeals again or if the case was appealed in a higherappellate court—for example, from an appellate court to the highest court. As generally used, law of the case states that, if an appellate court has passed on a legal question and remanded the case to the court below for further proceedings, the legal question thus determined by the appellate court will not be differently determined on a subsequent appeal in the same case where the facts remain the same.[3] The doctrine provides that an appellate court's determination on a legal issue is binding on both the trial court on remand and on the appellate court on a subsequent appeal given the same case and substantially the same facts.[4] The law of the case doctrine, however, is one of policy only and will be disregarded when compelling circumstances call for a redetermination of a point of law on prior appeal. This is particularly true where an intervening or a contemporaneous change in law has occurred where former decisions have been overruled or new precedent has been established by controlling authority.[5] The law of the case doctrine precludes reconsideration of a previously decided issue unless one of three exceptional circumstances exists: (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when a subsequent contrary view of the law is decided by the controlling authority, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.[6]",-1

"In the study ofair pollution, acritical loadis defined as a quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or morepollutantsbelow which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of theenvironmentdo not occur according to present knowledge.[1] Air pollution research in relation to critical loads has focused onnitrogenandsulfurpollutants. After these pollutants are emitted into theatmosphere, they are subsequently deposited intoecosystems.  Both sulfur and nitrogen deposition can acidify surface waters andsoils.  As addedaciditylowers thepHof water, fish and invertebrate health are negatively impacted.[2]Sulfur and nitrogen, as acidifying agents, may change soil nutrient content by removing calcium and releasing toxic aluminum, further impacting plants and animals.[3]Nitrogen deposition can also act as afertilizerin the environment and alter thecompetitive interactionsof plants, thereby favoring the growth of some plant species and inhibiting others, potentially leading to changes inspecies compositionandabundance.  The deposition of nitrogen contributes to nutrient enrichment in freshwater, coastal, andestuarineecosystems, which may causetoxic algal blooms, fish kills, andloss of biodiversity.[4][5]Air pollutants impact essentialecosystem servicessuch as air and water purification, decomposition and detoxification of waste materials, and climate regulation. When deposition is greater than the critical load of a pollutant for a particular location, it is considered acritical load exceedance,meaning the biota are at increased risk of ecological harm.  Some components of an ecosystem are more sensitive to deposition than others; therefore, critical loads can be developed for a variety of ecosystem components and responses, including (but not limited to) shifts in diatoms, increases in invasive grass species, changes in soil chemistry, decreased forest health, altered and reduced biodiversity, and lake and stream acidification. The history, terminology, and approach used to calculate critical loads differ by region and country.  The differences between approaches used by European countries and in the U.S. are discussed below.",-1

"Thecoat of arms ofHordalandshows two golden axes and a crown in red.[1]The initiative for a coat of arms for Hordaland was launched as early as 1918, but the county council waited until 1949 to officially start the process of adopting a coat of arms.[1]The following process took 12 years and the arms were officially granted on December 1, 1961.[1]One or two axes had been used as a royal symbol on Norwegian coins for centuries and theNorwegian Heraldic Authoritywas considering reserving the crossed axe symbol for the Norwegian state but eventually released it to the county of Hordaland.[1] The arms are derived from the old seal of the guild ofSaint Olav, King of Norway, fromOnarheiminTysnesmunicipality.[1]This seal was used by the delegates ofSunnhordlandin 1344 on the document issued on July 17 of that year to install kingHaakon V of Norway.[2]It was thus the oldest symbol used for the region and adapted as the arms in 1961. The age of the guild is unknown but it is believed to have been in existence in the 10th century.[2] The seal was that of the Olavbrothers but was used by delegates to represent all the farmers and populace ofSunnhordland.[2]The main motive of the seal is a coat of arms with a crown over two crossed axes, almost identical to the current coat of arms.[2]The axe was the holy symbol of saint Olav as he was martyred with an axe. There are two of them to representOlsok, 29 July and the lesser feast day of Saint Olav, 3 August.[2]The crown is the Crown of Saint Olav, King of Norway.

"Hydrobiologyis the science of life and life processes in water. Much of modern hydrobiology can be viewed as a sub-discipline ofecologybut the sphere of hydrobiology includestaxonomy, economic and industrial biology,morphology, and physiology. The one distinguishing aspect is that all fields relate to aquatic organisms. Most work is related tolimnologyand can be divided intolotic system ecology(flowing waters) andlentic system ecology(still waters). One of the significant areas of current research iseutrophication. Special attention is paid to biotic interactions inplanktonassemblage including themicrobial loop, the mechanism of influencingalgal blooms, phosphorus load, and lake turnover. Another subject of research is the acidification of mountain lakes.[1][2]Long-term studies are carried out on changes in the ionic composition of the water of rivers,[3]lakes and reservoirs in connection withacid rainandfertilization. One goal of current research is elucidation of the basic environmental functions of the ecosystem in reservoirs,[4]which are important for water quality management and water supply. Much of the early work of hydrobiologists concentrated on the biological processes utilized in sewage treatment andwater purificationespecially slow sand filters. Other historically important work sought to provide biotic indices for classifying waters according to the biotic communities that they supported. This work continues to this day in Europe in the development of classification tools for assessing water bodies for the EU water framework directive.[5] A hydrobiologist technician conducts field analysis for hydrobiology. They identify plants and living species, locate their habitat, and count them. They also identify pollutants and nuisances that can affect the aquatic fauna and flora. They take the samples and write reports of their observations for publications. A hydrobiologist engineer intervenes more in the process of the study. They define the intervention protocols and what samples should be taken. They plan and program the study campaigns, and then summarize their results. In the event of pollution, they propose solutions to improve the biological quality of water within the framework of the regulations in force. In the case of complex programs, hydrobiologists can work in a multidisciplinary team with botanists and zoologists. The hydrobiologist works on behalf of large public institutions of a scientific and technological nature (CNRS, INRA, IRD, CIRAD, IRSTEA ...), public institutions (Water Agencies, Regional Directorates environment, Higher Council of Fisheries, CEMAGREF ...), companies (EDF, Veolia environment, Suez environment, Saur, ...), local authorities, research departments, and associations (Federations of fishing, Permanent Centers for Environmental Initiatives ...).",-1

For the most part, they were used during the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts offirepowerinto a new location. Most countries have discontinued their use since road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, train tracks proved too vulnerable tosabotageand attacks from the air, and air transportation was an even more flexible way to relocate firepower to a new location. However, there have been occasional uses in the late 20th century and early 21st century.

It was given at Rome, at St. Peter's on July 19, 1950, the twelfth year of his Pontificate. The Pope portrays a mixed picture of his time: on one hand there are millions of people who come to Rome as pilgrims from all nations of the world. They give testimony of oneness in faith, brotherly unity, and piety.  On the other, the present social conditions of the people give reason for high anxiety and concern. The call for hate and class-warfare is not going to solve any problems.[1]They need to be tackled not with violence but by the law of justice.  In addition, the spectre of another war is looming: Real peace is only possible on the basis of Christian principles: Such principles and norms, in fact, recall men to truth, justice and charity; they put a restraint on their unruly desires; they force the senses to be obedient to reason; they move the reason to obey God; they produce this effect, that all men, even those who are rulers of the peoples, may recognize the freedom that is due to religion, which, beyond its primary purpose of leading souls to eternal salvation, has also another, of safeguarding and protecting the very foundations of the State.[3] But, referring toEastern EuropeandChina, without mentioning these countries, the Pope continues, in some parts of the world, these principles are trampled upon and the rights of the Church are violated.

"Gervase Paganellinherited the feudal barony of Dudley (which includedDudley Castle) around the year 1150. However, after rebelling against King Henry II, his castle was demolished. Gervase founded theCluniacPriory of St JamesinDudleyand probably founded theChurch of St Thomasin Dudley. He died in 1194. The first of the family of Paganell to hold Dudley Castle and the barony of Dudley was Fulke Paganell around the year 1100. Dudley Castle was originally a wooden Norman castle, built byAnsculf de Picquigny, a follower of William the Conqueror.[1]At the time of theDomesday surveyin 1086, the castle was in the possession of his sonWilliam fitz Ansculftogether with manors in theHome countiesand the English Midlands, which were rewards for services to the Conqueror. Dudley Castle was thecaputof the feudal barony. The Paganell family had origins in Normandy, where Fulke's father William was Lord of Moutiers Hubert.[2]It is not clear how Fulke came into possession of the barony of Dudley. One suggestion is that he married Beatrice ferch William, a daughter of William FitzAnsculf,[1]but it cannot be ruled out that he may have benefited from the previous owner being dispossessed after a failed rebellion.[3]The family name is still attached to one of their former Buckinghamshire possessions,Newport Pagnell. Dudley Castle was converted to a stone fortification by Fulke or his son and heir Ralph.[3]In the struggle for power betweenKing StephenandMatilda, a period of history known asThe Anarchy, Ralph took the side of Matilda, which led to the castle being besieged by Stephen in 1138.[4]Since the castle survived the siege, it is assumed that it had been rebuilt in stone by that time. Ralph was made Governor of the Castle of Nottingham in 1140.[5]Ralph's successor to the barony was his son, Gervase. Although the exact date of Gervase becoming Lord of Dudley is not known, he had inherited by 1150.[3]By 1154, he had married, his wife being the recently widowed Countess Isabel.[3]She had been previously married toSimon de Senlisand was the daughter ofRobert, Earl of Leicester.[6] In 1166, he was assessed as holding 55 and two-thirdsknight's fees.[1]Gervase was involved ina failed rebellionagainst King Henry II in 1173–4 that led to an order that the castle be demolished. He was later restored to the king's favour after making him a payment of a fine of 500marks.[7]It is not clear how much of the original stone castle was demolished, but it is usually assumed that the site remained an unfortified manor house until the second half of the 13th century.[8] Gervase founded aCluniac priory in Dudleydedicated to St James,[9][10]fulfilling a wish of his father, Ralph.[11]It is also thought that he founded the Church of St Thomas in Dudley.[12]The church was originally dedicated toThomas Becket, who was killed in 1170 and canonized in 1173. Gervase attended the coronation ofKing Richard Iin 1189.[6] When he died in 1194, his heir was his sister Hawise, who had married John de Somery. Their son,Ralph de Somerybecame the next baron.[13]",-1

"Show buildingis the name often given to various enclosed structures attheme parksthat contain attractions such as rides and entertainment shows.  The exteriors of such buildings may be themed on some or all sides, but their hidden backstage areas are normally very utilitarian, resemblingwarehousesorsound stages. Unthemed areas of show buildings typically have simple, practical walls withflat roofs.  Doors allow employees to enter and exit, and provide exits for guests during emergency or temporary ride shutdowns. One or more ladders and/or stairwells are often installed for roof access, and sometimes for access to scenes or backstage rooms that are located above ground level.Louvers, downspouts, electrical cables, and artificial lighting (often wall packs) are common sights as well. Techniques vary for hiding the buildings' industrial nature from the eyes of park guests. The most common ways include planting foliage to obstruct the views, adding themed exteriors to the visible areas, painting visible surfaces with colors that blend with the surroundings, and adding mounds of earth (berms) or solid walls between guests and buildings.  They may also be built partially or completely below ground level.Disneyland, for instance, contains many show buildings, some of which are disguised on all sides.  One example is the building containingMr. Toad's Wild Ride,Peter Pan's Flight, andAlice in Wonderland, which features themed facades of castle walls and a quaint European village. At attractions such asthe Haunted Mansion, most of the experience takes place in a green show building concealed behind a berm that separates it from the themed mansion, with the two structures connected by an underground passageway. All of theDisney theme parksutilize similar techniques to some extent. Some theme parks take less rigorous approaches.Universal Studios Hollywoodhides many of its show buildings in the same fashion, but other buildings, such as that housingRevenge of the Mummy, are allowed to remain (as a whole or in part) as real-world examples of utilitarian sound stages.  Some parks make no attempt to hide show buildings from guests and/or people outside the property, usually due to the cost involved, space limitations, and/or lack of interest in hiding the structures. For instance, all the buildings of theSanta Cruz Beach Boardwalkare clearly visible from Beach Street, which passes directly behind them. Similarly, the show building atKnott's Berry Farmthat formerly contained Kingdom of the Dinosaurs is clearly visible from Western Avenue, just a few yards away.[1]",-1

"Mineral processingoften relies on the formation of froth to separate rich minerals fromgangue. In the process, chemicals and air are added. The rich minerals entrap the air and move as bubbles to the top of a flotation cell while the sand and clays of no commercial values sink to the bottom to formtailings. The whole process may be done in tanks in series called roughers, scavengers and cleaners. Inoilsandextraction plants, the froth is formed to remove thebitumenand it is called oilsand froth. Oilsand froth is difficult to pump at very low speeds and at low temperatures. However above a certain speed in a steel pipe, water may separate and form a lubrication layer. The process is called self-lubrication and depending on the temperature (25 C - 45 C), the friction losses are between 10 and 20 times the equivalent friction losses of water. When entering acentrifugal pump, a low pressure forms at the eye of the impeller. Pre-rotation creates centrifugal forces that push the dense slurry towards the wall of the pipe while leaving a core of air at the center. According to Abulnaga (2004), the froth pump may use
-( a)  a very large eye diameter 
- (b)  an inducer or having the impeller vanes extend into the suction pipe
- (c) a recirculating pipe from the discharge side of the pump with pressurized froth to break up the bubbles at the eye
- (d) tandem vanes at the impeller shroud
- (e) split or secondary vanes at the shroud

"The6th South African Armoured Divisionwas the secondarmoureddivisionof theSouth African Armyand was formed duringWorld War II. Established in early 1943, it was based on a nucleus of men from the former1st South African Infantry Divisionwho had returned to South Africa after theSecond Battle of El Alameinin late 1942. The division was initially transferred toEgyptfor training, after which it served in theAlliedcampaign in Italyduring 1944 and 1945. In Italy, the division was initially deployed as part of theBritish Eighth Army, under command ofLieutenant-GeneralOliver Leese, and was then transferred to theU.S. Fifth Army, underLieutenant GeneralMark W. Clark, for the remainder of the Italian Campaign. The division operated as a strongly reinforced division and was frequently used to spearhead the advance of the Corps and Army to which it was attached.  They returned home after the end of the war in Italy and were disbanded in 1946. The division was also briefly active after the war from 1 July 1948 to 1 November 1949. The possibility of forming a South African armoured division was discussed as early as April 1941 between Major-GeneralGeorge Brink, Commander of the1st South African Infantry Divisionand Prime Minister (Field Marshal)Smuts. At this time, South Africa was struggling to maintain the manpower levels needed to sustain two infantry divisions in the field.[b]The3rd Divisionwas based in South Africa and was to provide the pool from which reinforcements were drawn to supplement the 1st and 2nd Divisions.  All South Africans serving outside of South Africa were volunteers and far fewer men than expected volunteered their services and the view was held that if this trend continued, it would be necessary to convert one infantry division to an armoured division, as an armoured division would require fewer men.[c]Later, the vision was to establish two armoured divisions, as lower manpower levels became more pronounced.[1] After theSecond Battle of El Alamein, the 1st Infantry Division was withdrawn to Quassasin with the understanding that its 1st Brigade would return to South Africa to regroup with the 7th Infantry Brigade (at this time the 7th Infantry Brigade was inMadagascar) to form the 1st South African Armoured Division. 1st Infantry Division's 2nd and 3rd Brigades would remain in Egypt to form the 6th South African Armoured Division which would replace the 2nd Infantry Division which had been captured atTobrukin June 1942.[1] By January 1943, the Allied leaders had decided at theCasablanca Conferenceto pursue the war byinvading Sicily, reducing the need for the number of armoured divisions as compared to those needed in theWestern Desert.[2]This, together with further manpower shortages led to the plans for a 1st South African Armoured Division being abandoned, with only the 6th Division being considered viable.  All of the 1st South African Infantry Division brigades were returned to South Africa for re-training and amalgamation with other units to form the nucleus of the armoured division. The division was officially formed in South Africa on 1 February 1943 with Major-GeneralW.H.E. Pooleas commander and sailed forPort Tewfikin Suez on 30 April 1943 as a two brigade division, comprising11th Armoured Brigadeand12th Motorised Brigade.[3] Training began in the desert at Khataba, north west of Cairo[4]and was focused on tank operations and integrating the Rhodesian elements into the division.[d]In addition, the lack of manpower had forced the merging of numerous units and much of the training time was spent on marrying up drills between the new composite units.[4]The period of training was finally concluded by a series of training exercises,Exercise Cape Townbeing the first from 1 to 3 December for the11th Armoured Brigade(11th Armd Bde) andExercise Durbanfrom 5 to 7 December for the 12th Motorised Brigade (12th Mot Bde). Training was concluded withExercise Tussle[e]as aBritish III Corpsoperation finishing on 21 January 1944[7]and on 23 January the division moved toHelwan.[4]By now, the division had been in Egypt for months due to indecision related to its role.[f] On 3 March 1944, the division was instructed to move toPalestineand the advance parties left on 7 March. On 12 March however, this movement order was countermanded and the division was instructed to move to Italy. One year after arriving in the Middle East, the division embarked from Alexandria between 14 and 16 April to arrive inTaranto, Italy on 20 and 21 April 1944.[9] Regrouping was still in progress after arrival in Italy, when the 12th Motorised Brigade with artillery and support elements was ordered to move to the area of Isernia to prepare to relieve the 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade in the Cassino area and to come under command of the2nd New Zealand Divisionin theBritish X Corps.[6]These were the first division troops to enter combat in Italy.[9]The South African Brigade held these positions until after the fall ofMonte Cassinoand the breakout from theAnzio beachhead, when they were withdrawn and reunited with the division.[10] Having formed part ofBritish Eighth Army's reserve, the division was moved forward and attached to the Canadian I Corps after the Canadians andPolish II Corpshad breached theHitler Linenorth ofCassino. After Rome had been taken by the Allies in early June 1944, the division was ordered to move up the Via Casalina to take over the spearhead of the Eighth Army'sBritish XIII Corps.[11]To bring the division up to a full complement of three brigades, theBritish 24th Guards Brigadewas placed under command, an association which lasted to the spring of 1945.[12]The division advanced with theTiber Riverto the east andLake Bolsenato the west at a rate of 10 miles (16 km) per day, outstripping their flanking units.[13]On 10 June the Armoured Brigade which was leading the advance, came up against the anti-tank screen of the newly arrived German 365th Infantry Division south ofCelleno. For the first (and only) time Brigadier Furstenburg was able to deploy all three of his armoured regiments and his motorised infantry battalion in battle to gain an important victory. Lieutenant-Colonel Papa Brits (Special Service Battalion [SSB]) and Lieutenant-Colonel Bob Reeves-Moore (Imperial Light Horse / Kimberley Regiment [ILH/KR]) receivedDSOsfor their leadership in the defeat of elements of the 365th Division.[6]11th Armd Bde's success permeated the whole division and on 12 June the division tookOrvieto, having advanced 75 miles (121 km) in ten days.  However, their daily rate of advance had been slowed considerably by consistently being in contact with the enemy.[14] By 17 June, theImperial Light Horseof the 11th Armd Bde had been stopped by the parachutists of theHermann Göring Divisionon their first attempt to enterChiusibut by 23 June, the town had been taken by theCape Town Highlanders.[15]During this attack on Chiusi, A Company ofFirst City/Cape Town Highlanderswas leading the attack up the terraces around the town.  During the night of 21–22 June, the company was surrounded by strong German infantry elements closely supported by tanks and its surviving members were forced to surrender by noon on 22 June. Since the disaster of the surrender of the2nd Infantry DivisionatTobruktwo years previously, the surrender of South African troops in the field had become a sensitive matter. This promptedPrime Minister Smuts, who had been meeting theBritish Chiefs of Staffon 21 June, to divert his aircraft toOrvietoairfield on his way back to South Africa to discuss the political and military consequences of this event with the division command.[6] By 28 June, after stiff fighting, theAlbert Line(referred to as the Trasimene Line by the Allies) had been broken and the Allies streamed north[15]with the 24th Guards Brigade reachingChiancianoand the 11th Armd Bde pushing north ofLake Montepulciano.[16]The Eighth Army's XIII Corps advance onFlorencewas led by theBritish 6th Armoured Divisionon the right,British 4th Infantry Divisionin the centre and the South African 6th Armoured Division on the left.  The division advanced in two columns throughRapolanoandPalazzuolountil they encountered theLXXVI Panzer Corpson the Georg Line, a delaying position on the north side of Route 73.[17] The strength of the Panzer Corps was not known initially and the leading elements of XIII Corps continued to probe forward expecting the German line to crumble under pressure without the need to launch a full-scale attack.[18]The Corps fed in more battalions in an attempt to secure the Monte Lignano high ground and fighting for the hill continued on 6 and 7 July, but the15th Panzer Grenadier Divisioncontinued to hold the heights.[17]The South African Division had been stopped on the left flank with the two Infantry Brigades spread over a 10-mile (16 km) front, the armour having been withdrawn into reserve because of the difficult terrain.  On 7 July, 2 New Zealand Division was brought forward from reserve and their attack together with the British 6th Armoured Division eventually took the high ground and caused the German Corps to withdraw towards the Heinrich Line behind theRiver Arnoon 15 July.  The South African Division could then continue their advance, directed on an axis towardsRadda-Greveon the western side of theChianti Mountains.[19] The division made good progress, advancing with two brigades leading the advance: the 12th Mot Bde astride the road defining the division's axis of advance and the Guards Bde on the right flank, on the slopes of the Chianti highlands. Radda was secured on the night of 17 July and orders were then received for the division to secure the heights of the Chianti Highlands.  The Guards Bde took Mt. Maione by a night attack on the night of 18/19 July supported by the tanks of thePretoria Regiment[20]while 12th Mot Bde attacked to take Mt. St. Michele (Pt 892) on 20 July.  The division now held the heights of the Chianti range, dominating theArno Valleyand the advances toFlorence.[20] On 20 JulyGeneral Kirkman, XIII Corps commander, issued orders for a ...powerful thrust to seize all crossings across the River Arno to the west of Florence.[20]This effort was to be concentrated on the 6th South African Armoured Division front.  The advance was to be led by the South African Division with the 4th Infantry Division to its right, supported on the flanks by the 6th British Armoured Division and the8th Indian Infantry Division.[20]The division's advance was slowed at the approaches toGrevedue to heavy mining, where a number of tanks were lost but eventually the 11th Armd Bde succeeded in capturing Mercatale, which was defended by the German356th Infantry Divisionsupported byTiger tanks.  The division advanced through Greve and were again stopped by the German4th Parachute Divisionon the River Greve[21]on 24 July.[22]The division had, however, outflanked the German Parachute Division, who then withdrew during the night of 24/25 July, allowing the South African, New Zealand and Indian Divisions to advance to the Paula Line which was reached on 28 July.[23] Kirkman again placed the South African and New Zealand Divisions as the spearhead of his Corps advance, this time to break the Paula Line and to take Florence.  The New Zealand Division would carry out the main assault and the South African Division would neutralise the enemy on the high ground west ofImprunetaand then clear Route 2 into Florence.  The attack was scheduled for 30 July 1944.[24]GeneralHarold Alexander, commander ofAllied Armies in Italy, had indicated that he had no intention of fighting in Florence and so Kirkman gave orders for the by-passing of the city.[25]On 31 July the heavy artillery support for the attack had resulted in an ammunition shortage and Kirkman ordered a 24-hour pause for fresh supplies to arrive.[25]TheDesert Air Forceflew over 100 sorties per day on 31 July and 1 August in support of the attack and by 3 August columns of South African, New Zealand and 4th Infantry Divisions were advancing towards Florence.  By 4 August, advance parties were exploring the outskirts of Florence to find that all bridges across the Arno River viable for military transport had been destroyed.[26]AnImperial Light Horse/Kimberley Regimentpatrol however found the smallerPonte Vecchiobridge intact and crossed it under heavy shelling, entering into the centre of the city at 4 am, to be the first allied troops to enter Florence.[27][g][h] After reaching Florence, General Pool recorded in a Special Order of the Day, that the division had ... covered 601 miles (967 km) since leaving its concentration area at Taranto, its artillery had fired 201,500 rounds, the Divisional Engineers had built sixty five bridges (one a day!) and had made 196 major deviations necessitated by 'blows' and demolitions.  The signallers had laid 3,752 miles (6,038 km) of telephone cable.[30]The division was then withdrawn into Eighth Army reserve for rest and maintenance in theSiena/Castelnuovoarea[31]until 17 August, when orders were issued for the division to be transferred from British XIII Corps toU.S. IV Corpsto partially replace divisions withdrawn to theU.S. Seventh Armyfor theassault of southern France.[31][i]The 6th South African Armoured Division was assigned to their new Corps in the U.S. Fifth Army as from 22 August 1944 and was replaced in XIII Corps by theBritish 6th Armoured Division.[33] To continue the main Allied thrust north from Florence, theArno Riverfirst had to be crossed.  Reconnaissance patrols from the First City/Cape Town Highlanders [FC/CTH] found suitable crossing points close to Le Piagge allowing the 12th Mot Bde to cross during the night of 28/29 August under light enemy artillery fire.[34]Reports from prisoners indicated that the German forces in front of the division were withdrawing, and this was confirmed by the sound of demolitions ahead of them.[34]The 12th Brigade, as well as the Guards Brigade were tasked to send fighting patrols forward to determine the extent of the withdrawal.  Reports indicated that the Germans had withdrawn across a wide front to what was to later become known as theGothic Line.  The division crossed the river thanks toBailey bridgeserected between the damaged abutments by the South African Engineers.[35]Under sporadic shelling and some units encountering light resistance, the operation was completed by 3 September.[36]General Pool, observing the lack of resistance ahead of the division, encouraged a rapid advance, but this was countermanded in order not to compromise the surprise of the main 5th Army attack north of Florence.[37]The order to wait and hold the Albano Massif until further notice was deeply resented by the division command and was considered representative of the persistent inflexibility displayed by the Fifth Army leadership.[38] The Eighth Army offensive on the German heldGothic Linewas assigned the codenameOliveand had commenced on 25 August 1944.[39]Ultrainterceptshad shown that the Allies had a significant numerical superiority in manpower, armour, air and artillery, although there were concerns regarding the relative inferiority of Allied tank armour and gun power as compared to German equipment.[40][41]The U.S. Fifth Army attack was launched on 10 September against the mountain bastions south ofBolognaand was led byU.S. II Corps.  As part of the plan, the 6th SA Armoured Division was ordered to advance along Route 64 leading to Vergato and Bologna and to capture the twin peaks of Monte Sole and Caprara di Marzabotto.[42]The division's 24th Guards Brigade were first to encounter the Gothic Line defences when the Brigade met strong resistance from two battalions of theLehr Brigadeas well as two battalions of the362nd Infantry Division, fighting from strongly fortified positions which had been prepared throughout the previous winter.[42] After being ordered to hold the Albano Massif, the 11th Armd Bde was forced due to the terrain to operate dismounted from their tanks in order to contain the German 362nd Infantry Division. By 22 September, demolitions were again heard and it became evident that the Germans had started withdrawing to Green Line II, the next layer of the Gothic Line defences.[43]OperationOliveofficially ended on 21 September 1944.[43]",4

The case was presided over by JusticeChan Sek Keong. The Court decided that the DG had failed to take into account relevant evidence adduced by the applicant's company which could have been capable ofrebuttingtheprima facieevidence of non-export, and had thus made an insufficient inquiry before arriving at his decision. Since the DG's demand had been based on an incorrect basis of fact and thus had been made contrary to law, the Court granted the applicant anorder of prohibitionthat barred the DG from deducting the sum from certainbankers' guaranteesthat the applicant's company had lodged with Customs as security. The case appears to have introduced error of material fact into Singapore case law as a ground ofjudicial review. While the termerror of material factwas not explicitly stated in the case, the Court applied the legal rule laid down in the UK caseSecretary of State for Education and Science v.

"Fabrosaurus(/ˌfæbrəˈsɔːrəs/[2]FAB-rə-SOR-əs) is adubiousextinctgenusofornithischiandinosaurthat lived during  theEarly Jurassicduring theHettangiantoSinemurianstages199 - 189mya. Fabrosauruswas named and described bypaleontologistLeonard Ginsburg in 1964 based on theholotypespecimen, MNHN LES9, a partial jawbone with three teeth. The nameFabrosaurusmeans Fabre's lizard, honoring Jean Fabre, a Frenchgeologistand a colleague of Ginsburg on the expedition that collected the fossil inBasutoland(nowLesotho). Thetype species,F. australis, was named for the location of the fossil in theElliot Formation, Lesotho,Southern Africa.Fabrosauruswas initially placed withinScelidosauridaeby Ginsburg, but later studies have placed it as a basal ornithischian. Subsequent discoveries included two crushed skulls and disarticulated post-cranial bones (including vertebrae, ribs, and limb bones), allowing for a more complete reconstruction. However, as additional ornithischian fossils were discovered, the features ofF. australiswere thought to be shared by other species, and by the 1990s and 2000s most authors working with the group foundFabrosaurusto be anomen dubium(doubtful name), finding theholotypematerial described by Ginsburg to be insufficient to distinguish a new taxon. Some claim the fossils represent simple variation ofLesothosaurus, which is regarded as a valid taxon. A 1959 expedition toSouth Africaby French palaeontologists François Ellenberger, Jean Fabre, and Leonard Ginsburg discovered remains in a fossiliferous level of the upper Red Beds of theStormberg Group(nowupper Elliot Formation) of atritylodontand an earlyornithischian, at a locality named Likhoele nearMafeteng, Basutoland (now Lesotho). Both specimens were then described by Ginsburg in 1961 and1964respectively, with the ornithischian being namedFabrosaurus australis.[1][3]Fabrosaurusis known from a single partial jaw bone with well-preserved teeth, stored at theMuséum national d'histoire naturelleas MNHN LES9.[1][4]Thegenus nameis in honour of Jean Fabre who was part of the expedition with Ginsburg, while thespecies nameis a reference to the country of origin.[1]Ginsburg namedFabrosaurusfor his partial jaw despite being aware that other far more complete material of early ornithischians had already been discovered from nearby localities.[5]This more complete material was found in a 1963-1964 expedition of theUniversity College Londonto Lesotho by K. Kermack and F. Mussett, and included at least three partial skulls and skeletons,NHMUKRUB17 and RUB23. NHMUK RUB17 was found on the north side of Likhoele Mountain, while NHMUK RUB23 was from a hillside between Fort Hartley and Cutting Camp in southwest Lesotho.[6] These new specimens were described by Australian palaeontologistRichard Thulbornas material ofFabrosaurusin 1970, 1971 and 1972, greatly expanding the known information of the taxon and making it the best-known early ornithischian.[6][7]While Ginsburg had originally consideredFabrosaurusto be ascelidosaurid, Thulborn instead identified it as a separate group of early ornithischian (fabrosaurs), which was namedFabrosauridaein 1972 by British palaeontologistPeter Galton.[8]However, in 1974 British palaeontologistAlan J. Charigand South African palaeontologistAlfred W. Cromptonfound that the features characteristic of theholotypeofFabrosaurus, MNHN LES9, were not unique to it among early ornithischians, and that the taxon should be considered an undiagnosticnomen dubium. As a result, they removed the specimens described by Thulborn fromFabrosaurus, restricting it to its type.[9]This led to Galton separating the more complete material as the new genusLesothosaurusin 1978, leavingFabrosaurusas a potentially dubious taxon restricted to its type, though he believed it could be separated fromLesothosaurus.[10]Further material ofLesothosauruswas found by a joint expedition of the NHMUK,University of London,Yale UniversityandSouth African Museumin 1967-1968 but only described later in 1984.[4]The separation ofLesothosaurusandFabrosauruswas disputed in 1991 by South African palaeontologist C.E. Gow, but supported by American palaeontologistPaul C. Sereno, with later authors agreeing thatFabrosauruscannot be distinguished.[5][4][11]",0

"Trypsinizationis the process of cell dissociation usingtrypsin, aproteolyticenzyme which breaks down proteins, to dissociate adherent cells from the vessel in which they are being cultured. When added to cell culture, trypsin breaks down the proteins that enable the cells to adhere to the vessel. Trypsinization is often used to pass cells to a new vessel. When the trypsinization process is complete the cells will be in suspension and appear rounded. For experimental purposes,cellsare often cultivated in containers that take the form of plastic flasks or plates. In such flasks, cells are provided with agrowth mediumcomprising the essential nutrients required for proliferation, and the cells adhere to the container and each other as they grow. This process ofcell cultureortissue culturerequires a method to dissociate the cells from the container and each other. Trypsin, anenzymecommonly found in thedigestive tract, can be used to digest theproteinsthat facilitate adhesion to the container and between cells. Once cells have detached from their container it is necessary to deactivate the trypsin, unless the trypsin is synthetic, as cell surface proteins will also be cleaved over time and this will affect cell functioning.[1]Serum can be used to inactivate trypsin, as it contains protease inhibitors.[2]Because of the presence of these inhibitors, the serum must be removed before treatment of a growth vessel with trypsin and must not be added again to the growth vessel until cells have detached from their growth surface - this detachment can be confirmed by visual observation using a microscope. Trypsinization is often used to permit passage of adherent cells to a new container, observation for experimentation, or reduction of the degree of confluency in a culture flask through the removal of a percentage of the cells.",-1

In some performing arts, such aship hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style.

When described themushroomis part of in the private collection of Ron Buckley ofFlorence, Kentucky,USA.[1]The collection has been sold and is now owned by Deniz Erin ofIstanbul, Turkey.[4]AB-368was collected from one of the amber mines in theHukawng Valleyarea southwest ofMaingkhwan,Kachin Region, NorthernMyanmar.[1]It was first studied by a pair of researchers led byDr George PoinarfromOregon State Universitywho worked with Ron Buckley.  Poinar and Buckley published their 2007type descriptioninMycological Research, journal ofThe British Mycological Society.[1]The genus has been assigned theMycoBanknumberMB501250, with the species being assigned numberMB501251.[1] The generic epithetEntropezitesisGreekin derivation and is a combination of the wordsentropemeaning to turn inward anditeswhich means pertaining to referencing the hypermycoparasitic nature of the species.[1] When published,Entropezites patricii, its hostMycetophagites atreboraandM. atrebora's hostPalaeoagaracites antiquuswere the first known instance of hyperparasitism onmycoparasitismto be described in the fossil record, and the oldest.  The fossil shows that this type of fungal parasitic relationship had been established by the Albian, 100 million years ago.[1]An earlier instance of mycoparasitism is known from the extinct speciesPalaeoserenomyces allenbyensis[1]andCryptodidymosphaerites princetonensis[2]described in 1998 fromchertsfound inBritish Columbia,Canada.[5] The holotype ofEntropezitesconsists ofhyphaewhich form a complex and extensive intergrowth with theMycetophagites atreborahost hyphae. The fungi are preserved in a rectangular piece of yellow amber approximately 3.25 cm (1.28 in) by 1.25 cm (0.49 in) by 1.0 cm (0.39 in). Thepileusis 2.2 millimetres (0.087 in) in diameter and possesses a convex shape with the flesh a bluish gray color and hairy.[1]The hyphae are very small, ranging from 1 to 2.5μmin diameter andhyaline. The nonseptate hyphae are branched, intergrown with and penetrating the host hyphae.Entropeziteshyphae penetrate host areas of necrotic tissue. The specimen sports a number of simple, hyaline conidiophores 7–10 μm in length which are borne upright from the hyphae. Each of the conidiophores is borne singly or as sparse clusters and are upright or almost upright. The single-celledcondiaare borne in chains on the conidiophore tips. As with the other organs ofEntropezites, the spherical to cylindrical condia are hyaline in coloration.  Also present are possiblezygosporesranging from 15 to 30 μm in diameter.[1] Entropezitespresents the oldest evidence of fungal hyperparasitism by other fungi in the fossil record.[1]The fossil displays a complex interrelationship between three different fungal genera. The preservedPalaeoagaracites antiquuscap is host to both amycoparasiticfungus and ahypermycoparasiticfungus.[1]The surface of thegilled fungusPalaeoagaracitesspecimen hosts theMycetophagites atreboramycelia.  The mycelia ofMycetophagitesare found across the surface of theP. antiquuspileus, and the hyphae penetrate into theP. antiquustissues themselves, forming necrotic areas.Mycetophagitesis in turn host to a hypermycoparasitic necrotrophic fungus speciesEntropezites patricii.  Hyphae ofEntropezitesare preserved, penetrating theMycetophagiteshyphae forming areas of decomposing tissues.Entropezitesalso displays a range of growth stages for probablezygospores.[1] The combined distinguishable characters ofEntropeziteswere not enough for Poinar and Buckley to place the genus further than Hypocrealesincertae sedis.  Where the hyphae ofEntropezitespenetrate into theMycetophagiteshyphae, distinct areas of necrotic tissue appear to be present.  Thenecrotrophicnature of the interaction is similar to the modern generaPenicillium,SchizophyllumandTrichoderma. However the extensive intergrowth of the host and parasite hyphae is distinct from those found in the modern genera.[1]",0

"Baltimore classificationis a system used toclassifyvirusesbased on their manner ofmessenger RNA(mRNA) synthesis. By organizing viruses based on their manner of mRNA production, it is possible to study viruses that behave similarly as a distinct group. Seven Baltimore groups are described that take into consideration whether the viral genome is made ofdeoxyribonucleic acid(DNA) orribonucleic acid(RNA), whether the genome is single- ordouble-stranded, and whether thesenseof a single-stranded RNA genome is positive or negative. Baltimore classification also closely corresponds to the manner ofreplicatingthe genome, so Baltimore classification is useful for grouping viruses together for bothtranscriptionand replication. Certain subjects pertaining to viruses are associated with multiple, specific Baltimore groups, such as specific forms oftranslationof mRNA and the host range of different types of viruses. Structural characteristics such as the shape of the viralcapsid, which stores the viral genome, and the evolutionary history of viruses are not necessarily related to Baltimore groups. Baltimore classification was created in 1971 by virologistDavid Baltimore. Since then, it has become common among virologists to use Baltimore classification alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. In 2018 and 2019, Baltimore classification was partially integrated into virus taxonomy based on evidence that certain groups were descended from common ancestors. Various realms, kingdoms, and phyla now correspond to specific Baltimore groups.",-1

"TheParaíba Valleywas the stage of military deployments by opposing forces during the1964 Brazilian coup d'état: the rebel2nd Army, coming fromSão PaulotowardsRio de Janeiroalong theVia Dutrahighway, and the loyalist School-Unit Group (Grupamento de Unidades-Escola; GUEs), coming from Rio de Janeiro in the opposite direction. The 2nd Army was commanded by GeneralAmaury Kruel, in rebellion against the government of presidentJoão Goulart. The GUEs, led by Anfrísio da Rocha Lima, was subordinated to GeneralArmando de Morais Âncora, from the1st Army. Such movements were in progress or preparation in the early hours of 1 April, although the loyalist 2nd Army General Euryale de Jesus Zerbini delayed his army's movement. TheMilitary Academy of Agulhas Negras(Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras; AMAN), led by GeneralEmílio Garrastazu Médici, and the 1st Armored Infantry Battalion (1º Batalhão de Infantaria Blindado; 1º BIB), were halfway the road, respectively in the municipalities ofResendeandBarra Mansa. Médici, forced to choose a side, joined the coup. The 1st BIB did the same. In the morning, before the arrival of the 2nd Army and the GUEs, Médici occupied Resende and used his cadets to establish defensive positions along Via Dutra, towards Barra Mansa, from where he could resist the loyalists. The forces from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro arrived around noon, with the former remaining further back, in Resende andItatiaia, and the latter around Barra Mansa, with the academy's force in the middle, facing the loyalists. Combat, if it occurred, would begin between the cadets and GUEs soldiers. The loyalists were elite troops, with superior numbers and weaponry. The use of cadets on the front line also had a bad record in other countries. What Médici had in his favor was the effect of a psychological brake on the loyalist officers, who were unwilling to attack. Of the three artillery batteries sent against the academy, two immediately crossed the lines and defected to the rebels. No confrontation occurred, as in the afternoon operations were interrupted by the arrival of generals Kruel and Âncora to negotiate within the academy. The defense mounted by Médici is considered important in forcing Âncora to negotiate, but it was part of a larger context of deterioration in the government's position. The resulting meeting would once and for all mark theHistory of Brazil: the end of the 1st Army's resistance to the coup and the return of the troops to their barracks. Médici's reputation among the military grew, and his decision became part of the Army's collective memory. The 1st BIB did not participate in the meeting of the military forces, as it was inVolta Redonda, where trade unionists, who opposed to the coup, unsuccessfully tried to paralyze theCompanhia Siderúrgica Nacional, revealing themselves to be less organized than the military and industrial leaders.",-1

"Quṭb al-Dawla Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Jaʾfar ibn Fallāh(Arabic:قطب الدولة علي بن جعفر بن فلاح) (fl.1000 – 1021) was aFatimidcommander and governor in the service of Caliphal-Hakim(r.996–1021). Ali was a son ofJa'far ibn Falah, a prominentKutami Berbergeneral. Ali succeeded his brother Sulayman, a general who had served governor ofDamascusin the late 10th century, as head of the family.[1]After the death of Sulayman's successor as governor of Damascus, the Berber commander Jaysh ibn al-Samsama, in 1000, Ali became governor.[2]Ali returned to Egypt around 1005 or before. There, he faced a nomadic Arab–Berber army led by theUmayyadleaderAbu Rakwa. The latter defeated Ali atGizaand news of his defeat to Abu Rakwa's nomads caused panic inCairo. Abu Rakwa skipped Cairo to raid theFayyumoasis to the south, where he was defeated by a Fatimid army underal-Fadl ibn Salih.[3] Ali most likely is the person credited in an inscription found above the mosque ofSalamiyahin central Syria for erecting a mausoleum for one of the Fatimids'hidden imamsAbd Allah. Ali had captured Salamiyah for the Fatimids and likely built the mausoleum in 1009. It was later repaired by the local chiefKhalaf ibn Mula'ibin 1088.[4][5] In July 1013 the Fatimid caliphal-Hakimbestowed the titleQutb al-Dawla(Axis of the State) on Ali and appointed him at the head of a 24,000-strong, Kutami army to rein in theJarrahids, aBedouintribe which controlledPalestine.[6][7]Ali entered Palestine's capitalRamla, and the sons of the Jarrahid chieftainMufarrij ibn Daghfal, Ali and Mahmud, announced their loyalty to al-Hakim.
